## About

The Multiple Disease Prediction Bot is a machine learning model designed to predict up to 40 different diseases based on input symptoms. The model is trained on a dataset with approximately 131 to 133 parameters and utilizes three different training models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB).

Please note that when providing input to the bot, it's important to format the symptoms as follows: "Itching,Skin_Rash,Nodal_Skin_Eruptions." Incorrect formatting may lead to false predictions or errors.

## Features

- Predicts up to 40 different diseases.
- Utilizes approximately 131 to 133 parameters for training.
- Trained on three different models: SVM, RF, and NB.

## Usage

To use the Multiple Disease Prediction Bot, follow these steps:

1. Open the "Multiple disease prediction with spyder.py" file using an appropriate IDE like Spyder.
2. Format the input symptoms as "Itching,Skin_Rash,Nodal_Skin_Eruptions."
3. Run the code to get disease predictions.

Remember to ensure that the input is properly formatted to receive accurate predictions.
